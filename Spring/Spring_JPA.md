JPA: The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification for mapping Java objects to database tables. Annotations like @Entity point to JPA provider (Hibernate) implementations of JPA specifications. AKA JPA specifies what an Entity is and Hibernate provides the implementation for that interface or specification.

Hibernate: Hibernate is a JPA provider. This means it provides an implementation for the JPA specification.

Spring Data JPA: Spring Data JPA is an abstraction that makes it easier to work with a JPA provider. Specifically Spring Data JPA provides a set of interfaces for easily creating data access repositories.
