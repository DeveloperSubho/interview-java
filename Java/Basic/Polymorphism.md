Static vs Dynamic Polymorphism
|Static Polymorphism|Dynamic Polymorphism|
|---|---|
|Also known as compile time polymorphism|Also known as Run time polymorphism|

|Achieved by method overloading|Achieved by method overriding.|

|Uses the concept of compile time binding(or early binding) Connecting method call to method body is known as binding.|Uses the concept of runtime binding (or late binding).|

|Slower than Dynamic polymorphism|Faster than static polymorphism.|

|To implement static polymorphism inheritance is not necessary|To implement dynamic polymorphism inheritance is necessary.|
